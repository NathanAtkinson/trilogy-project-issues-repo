# trilogy-project-issues-repo

## This repo is used to coordinate bug fixes and feature requests.

### When creating an issue, please:
- [ ] Search to make sure that an issue doesn't already exist
- [ ] Try to keep it small. The smaller the request is, the easier it is to implement on a weekend.
- [ ] Note if it's a bug or feature request
- [ ] <s>Be sure to fill in the issues template completely.</s> (TODO: Setup issues template)
- [ ] Profit
